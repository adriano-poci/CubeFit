* Read in NNLs `L2` ridge from environment variable in `pipeline_runner.solve_all_mp_batched`
* Use the seed vector as a numerical prior during the Kaczmarz solving in `kaczmarz_solver_cchunk_mp_nnls`
* Started history in `cube_debug`
* Added `nnls_seed_diagnostics` to `cube_debug` to investigate how the NNLS seed behaves as a full solution
* Implement global RMSE evaluation, and keep only globally-best solution in `kaczmarz_solver_cchunk_mp_nnls`
* Optionally disable seed prior in `kaczmarz_solver_cchunk_mp_nnls`
